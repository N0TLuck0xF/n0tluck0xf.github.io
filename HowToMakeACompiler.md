To make a compiler, you need several key components and a good understanding of both programming language theory and system architecture. Here's what you need:

1. **Lexical Analyzer (Scanner)** - Breaks source code into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and operators.

2. **Syntax Analyzer (Parser)** - Builds a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens according to the grammar rules.

3. **Semantic Analyzer** - Checks for semantic errors and type consistency while adding type information to the AST.

4. **Intermediate Code Generator** - Converts the AST into an intermediate representation (IR) that is easier to optimize and translate.

5. **Code Optimizer** - Improves the intermediate code for efficiency, reducing size or execution time.

6. **Code Generator** - Translates the optimized IR into target machine code or assembly.

7. **Symbol Table** - Maintains information about identifiers and their attributes throughout compilation.

8. **Error Handler** - Detects, reports, and potentially recovers from errors at various stages.

For technical knowledge, you'll need:
- Formal language theory
- Data structures and algorithms
- Computer architecture
- Target platform specifics (instruction set, calling conventions, etc.)
- Knowledge of the source language's syntax and semantics

And for practical implementation:
- A development environment
- Testing framework
- Documentation tools
- Version control system
- Possibly compiler-construction tools like parser generators

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific component or aspect of compiler development?
